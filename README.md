# Cookbook

This simple Angular project is a recipe book cum shopping list, with basic features such as adding, editing and deleting recipes. Users can also send the ingredients to the shopping list. There is also a basic sign up and log in feature in the app.

Note: \
While this project has been updated to Angular 14, it mainly uses items from previous versions of Angular. Standalone components(from Angular 14) were not used.

## Motivation

Since I am learning Angular from Maximillian on Udemy, it was good that I followed along his tutorial to create this, which allows me to better understand the basic concepts of Angular.

## Additional Things to Do

1. To finish up the unit testing module and the NgRx module. Currently still WIP.
2. Read up on Angular 14
